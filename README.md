# Mesh-Growth-Rate-Finder
Most CFD meshing software require the number of divisions, minimum size and growth rate, but it's hard to figure out the growth rate to use (especially, when you have a large number of divisions) for uniform growth. This is a simple code written in matlab to find the growth rate of a mesh for given values of edge length, number of divisions and minimum cell size.
